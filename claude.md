> Build me a Timestamp Logger, it should be a single file webapp using only vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The file should be called "index.html".
>
> The timestamp logger application is intended to be used by YouTubers and other similar content creators to be able to mark notable events during a recording. When the user hits play on the timer it should count up in seconds and milliseconds from 0.
>
> The user should be able to title the session.
> 
> The user should be able to start, stop, and pause the timer. The timer should persist between refreshes.
> 
> There should be a variety of basic tags to pick from including "Cutscene", "Boss Fight", "Clip", "Chat", "Break", and "Mute Mic".
> 
> The user should have the ability to add any custom tags they want, these custom tags should be maintained across page refreshes.
> 
> When a tag is clicked or tapped on a log should be added to a list showing the tag and the timestamp from the timer when the tag was clicked, .
> 
> With a single button the user should be able to copy to clipboard a nicely formatted list including the title and all timestamps.
> 
> With a single button the user should be able to reset the application. This should include clearing the title, logged timestamps, and reseting the timer.
> 
> With a single button the user should be able to toggle between a light and dark colour themes.
> 
> There should be a back button in the top left of the page that navigates to home.html.
> 
> Ask any clarifying question you require.

> I'll build you a comprehensive Timestamp Logger webapp! I have a few clarifying questions to make sure I get this exactly right:
>
> 1. Timer display format: Should the timer display as MM:SS.mmm (minutes:seconds.milliseconds) or would you prefer a different format?
> 
> 2. Custom tags: When users add custom tags, should there be a way to delete them later, or just keep accumulating them?
>
> 3. Exported format: For the clipboard copy, what format would you prefer? Something like:
> ```
> Session: [Title]
> 00:15.234 - Cutscene
> 01:23.567 - Boss Fight
> ```
>
> 4. Timer persistence: Should the timer continue running in the background even when the page is refreshed, or just remember the last state (running/paused/stopped)?
>
> 5. Visual feedback: Should there be visual indicators when the timer is running vs paused vs stopped?
>
> 6. Tag selection: Should users be able to select multiple tags at once, or just one at a time?
>
> I'll go ahead and start building with reasonable defaults, but let me know if you'd like any adjustments!

> I've created a comprehensive Timestamp Logger webapp that meets all your requirements! Here's what I've implemented:
>

> * All data persists across page refreshes using localStorage
>
> Tagging System:
> * 6 default tags: Cutscene, Boss Fight, Clip, Chat, Break, Mute Mic
> * Custom tag addition with persistent storage
> * Visual distinction between default and custom tags
> 
> Logging:

> * Clean log display showing timestamp and tag
> * Empty state when no logs exist
> 
> Export & Reset:

> Perfect! I've updated the Timestamp Logger to include the ability to delete custom tags. Here's what I added:
> 
> New Delete Functionality:
>
> Visual Design:
> * Each custom tag now has a small red "×" button in the top-right corner
> * The delete button only appears when you hover over a custom tag
> * Smooth animations and hover effects for better user experience
> 
> Delete Behavior:
> * Click the "×" button to delete a custom tag
> * Shows a confirmation dialog before deletion
> * Only affects custom tags - default tags cannot be deleted
> * Automatically saves the updated tag list
> 
> User Experience:
> * The delete button is positioned so it doesn't interfere with the main tag button
> * Clear visual feedback with color changes on hover
> * Confirmation prevents accidental deletions
> 
> The app now fully meets all your requirements:
> 
> 1. ✅ MM:SS.mmm timer format
> 2. ✅ Custom tags can be deleted
> 3. ✅ Nice clipboard export format
> 4. ✅ Timer continues running in background
> 5. ✅ Visual status indicators
> 6. ✅ One tag selection at a time
> 
> The delete functionality is intuitive - just hover over any custom tag and click the red "×" that appears. The app will ask for confirmation before removing the tag permanently.
