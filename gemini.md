> The timestamp logger application is intended to be used by YouTubers and other similar content creators to be able to mark notable events during a recording. When the user hits play on the timer it should count up in seconds and milliseconds from 0.
>
> The user should be able to title the session.
> 
> The user should be able to start, stop, and pause the timer. The timer should persist between refreshes.
> 
> There should be a variety of basic tags to pick from including "Cutscene", "Boss Fight", "Clip", "Chat", "Break", and "Mute Mic".
> 
> The user should have the ability to add any custom tags they want, these custom tags should be maintained across page refreshes.
> 
> When a tag is clicked or tapped on a log should be added to a list showing the tag and the timestamp from the timer when the tag was clicked, .
> 
> With a single button the user should be able to copy to clipboard a nicely formatted list including the title and all timestamps.
> 
> With a single button the user should be able to reset the application. This should include clearing the title, logged timestamps, and reseting the timer.
> 
> With a single button the user should be able to toggle between a light and dark colour themes.
> 
> There should be a back button in the top left of the page that navigates to home.html.
> 
> Ask any clarifying question you require.

# OUT

> Got it. The custom tags will persist even after a "Reset Application" action.
